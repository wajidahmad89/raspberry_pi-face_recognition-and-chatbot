face recognition + python chatbot on raspberry pi



Check out my blog:
www.rexythebot.com


I talk about how to utilise machine learning to add face recognition + chatbot functionalities to your raspberry pi.

The concept is that once someone is recognised, the chatbot starts a conversation.
You will need a mic for speech input and you can use earphones for speech output.

I use espeak for the speech output.
