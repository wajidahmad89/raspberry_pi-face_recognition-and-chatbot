I talk about how to utilise machine learning to add face recognition + chatbot functionalities to your raspberry pi.

The concept is that once someone is recognised, the chatbot starts a conversation.
You will need a mic for speech input and you can use earphones for speech output.

I use espeak for the speech output.
